React Web App created to showcase Server Time and Prometheus Metrics

Basic JEST unit testing added to keep within time constraints. Issue causing component tests to fail and would require some time to better understand axios in the React framework - with my experience being with Angular and Wiremock Servers.

Snapshot testing would have been nice to add to compare the component before and after the two time intervals to ensure the element values updated as expected. The Axios and React interaction understanding would be needed to implement this fully.

Liniting checks completed and passed.
